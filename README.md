### Getting Started

```sh
npm install
```

> You have to have Node (version >= 6) installed on your machine. This project depends on `webpack-dev-server` which recommends you use version 6 for the moment because there are some known issues with version 7. *On my machine I have been using node v7 with no issues.*

### Running in development mode
```sh
npm run dev
```

The app is available on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Building for production
```sh
npm run build
```
